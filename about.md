## About Me
I was trained as a computer scientist and have earned a BSc., MSc. and Phd. In
graduate school I studied wireless mesh networks, although I was involved in a
variety of other projects.

Towards the end of graduate school I co-founded a robotics company. After that
I joined a company in Vancouver and co-founded a company within it working on
a mobile mesh networking library for Android phones.

Hackathons are great! I've participated in them (and won some), I mentor, coach
and judge at them now more often. Tech meetups are also a fun way to keep up
with the most developments and to meet new people. If you're going to one near
me, shoot me a message to meet up.

Occasionally, I speak at conferences, workshops and meetups. If you want me to
give a talk feel free to reach out.
