This may be only marginally related to computer science, but if you are like me, you may also have an interest in physics (and for those who don't I think there are some lectures on quantum computers which may be cool). The festival runs in October and there is about a week or so of events including lectures, panel discussions and even live taping of TV shows (Steve Paiken if you are familiar with his show). You can register starting today for some of the events and next week for some as well. Here is the link: https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/news/quantum-cosmos-coming
