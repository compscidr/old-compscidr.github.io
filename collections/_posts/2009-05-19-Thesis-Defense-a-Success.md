Last Friday I successfully defended my thesis at Guelph. The room was full with lots of friends, students and faculty and everything went fairly smoothly. It definitely feels great to be done after almost two years building up to this. Today I finished the final revisions and submitted all of the copies with an insane amount of paperwork to Grad Program Services. Two to three weeks from now I should get my final bound copy of my thesis and it should soon be available online and in libraries :). For anyone interested in reading it, email me and I can send you a pdf copy.

Here are some pictures from the day:

After some relaxing, a conference in UK and some business related projects I will finally have some time (hopefully) to update the site with all the projects, articles and source I have been slowly working on the past few months in between working like crazy on my M.Sc. This fall I start my Ph.D. which will likely at least start from the work I just worked on.
