Tomorrow I present at Research Day at University of Guelph at 1:30pm. Here is the abstract for the presentation:

**Title**: Radio Resource Management in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks

**Abstract**: Wireless networks are quickly becoming pervasive allowing users to stay connected anytime
anywhere. However, current implementations are not seamless. There are many different radio
access technologies (RATs), for example 802.11 (Wifi), 802.15 (Bluetooth, Zigbee), 802.16 (WiMAX)
and 3g cellular / mobile technologies which are not inter-operable. The aim of heterogeneous
wireless networking is to bridge the technological gap between the existing equipment and software.
When this occurs, the wireless spectrum may be used more efficiently and it is expected users will
have a better experience using the networks. Ideally, the devices should be able to select the best
RAT at a given moment in time based on some criteria, for example cost or capacity. A background
on the architecture of heterogeneous networks will be presented. Problems such as handover, radio
resource management and quality of service (QoS) will be discussed and a direction for further
study will be established.

*Update*: Here are the slides from the presentation for those who are interested:
