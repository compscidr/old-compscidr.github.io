This month I start for the second time at the University of Guelph, this time for my Ph.D. degree. I am continuing to work under the same supervisor and hopefully continue along with similar research in the area of wireless mesh networks. Our lab (PerWin) is supposed to be getting a bunch of new equipment from a company in Toronto so I will finally be able to move away from simulation and into some practical experiments.

In a slightly related note, I am attending two wireless network conferences in Ontario in the upcoming weeks. At the end of September I am volunteering at the adhocnets 2009 conference in Niagara Falls. I am quite excited about one of the keynote speakers (Prof. Ian Akyildiz) who has written some excellent survey papers in the area. The same week I am attending the IEEE TIC STH conference at Ryerson University in Toronto. I am presenting a paper on cross layer scheduling and resource allocation in wireless mesh networks.

Update: The paper from the TIC STH Conference is available via IEEE Xplore:
"[A review of cross-layer scheduling and resource allocation for wireless mesh networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5444393)"

Update: Here are some pictures from the conference:
