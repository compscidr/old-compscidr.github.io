This past week I travelled to the UK to present at my first International Conference - Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA 2009) in Bradford, UK. My presentation was on "Fair Scheduling in Wireless Mesh Networks with Multiple Gateways". The paper for the conference was published in the main AINA conference and I presented on the first day, in the first session. It was nice to have it over with right away so that I could relax and focus on meeting as many people as possible at the conference.

There were people from 40 different countries there and I feel like I met someone from almost every one of them at some point. There were over 300 people at AINA this year, which apparently is down from the last couple of years (where they had 4-500) but it was still a great conference for me. I will post my slides from my presentation in this post in case anyone is interested, along with a link to the paper once it is available. I submitted another paper last night for a conference in Toronto and am working on two more papers, so hopefully I'll be travelling soon. I am trying to aim for ICC in South Africa next year.

Here are a few pictures from the conference.

**Abstract:**
This paper addresses the problem of scheduling in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). The paper first discusses existing scheduling algorithms and classifies them based on the technique they use and their implementation frameworks.Then detailed discussions of the proposed scheduling method are presented. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of fair scheduling with the method that does not use fair scheduling. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheduling method has better performance with respect to the metrics used for performance evaluation.
