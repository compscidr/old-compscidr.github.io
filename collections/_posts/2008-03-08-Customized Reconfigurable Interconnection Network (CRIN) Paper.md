Recently, I have begun working on a new research project dealing with some graph
theory with Dr. Hongbing Fan at Wilfrid Laurier University. As the title
suggests the problem works with customized reconfigurable interconnection
networks (CRINs). Dr. Fan has proposed an algorithm which attempts to minimize
the connections within a network based on a set of routing requirements.

Since December of 2007 I have been working at implementing, testing and
experimenting the algorithm as well as providing feedback and new ideas for
improvements. The paper is almost ready to be submitted for publication this so
hopefully I will be able to provide a link to it in the future.

In relation with my thesis, I am planning on making use of the CRIN algorithm
to attempt to optimize wireless network protocols. There still needs to be some
experimentation and research to determine if in fact the algorithm can be used
in this way however I feel optimistic that this is the case.

There is also the potential that the source code for the CRIN implementation
may be made open source and released for use by anyone. If this is the case it
will be uploaded to this site in the future.
