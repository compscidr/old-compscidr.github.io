So I've recently come across a bunch of free computers and I've decided to try to hook them together to form a beowulf style cluster for running some of my simulations on since I think I can modify the code to be parallel. I have tested all of the computers and have them spread across my basement floor however I seem to have a problem. I need a way to enclose them into some sort of case or storage area. I don't want to use wood and have been exploring some kind of plexiglass or similar material without much luck. So far the best idea I've seen has been the "[Microwulf](http://www.calvin.edu/~adams/research/microwulf/)".

Anyway, until I start to actually build thing I have decided that I would try to get suggestions through this blog and maybe through some forums on what materials I could use to get these motherboards organized in a reasonable way. (Note: I have extremely limited handyman type skills and a low budget since I'm a student.) Keep in mind that I need a way to not only house the motherboards but also power supplies, a couple of switches and maybe some hard drives. I have 15 working computers so far and do not want to use the standard pc cases because I don't want a wall of computers in my house. Feel free to offer up any suggestions and check back soon for pictures of the progress!

Update: I have added a project page for the SCrappy Cluster
