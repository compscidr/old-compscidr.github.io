Yesterday I found out that a paper I helped out with got accepted to [COCOA 2008](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-85097-7)
Conference in St. John's Newfoundland. This is the first academic paper I have
worked on, and also the first one that has been accepted to a conference so I
am extremely excited.

The paper is on a greedy reduction algorithm that finds the minimum number of
connections required for a set of routing requirements. I have probably
mentioned something about it in earlier posts. The algorithm has quite a few
applications. My advisor, Dr. Fan plans to use it for designing circuits,
networks-on-chip and FPGAs and I have used it in a simulation for wireless
networks. I will post the paper sometime after I get the go-ahead from my
advisor, which I imagine will be sometime after it has been officially
published.

I realize this post is somewhat sort and there's not much to it but there's not
much time for posting these days since the advisors are pushing me to decide on
a new direction for my thesis within the next couple of days. So back to work
for me, yay reading!
