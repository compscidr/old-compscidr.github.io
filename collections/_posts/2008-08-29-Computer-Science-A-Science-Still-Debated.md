As an update to my previous post on this subject "[Computer Science, A Science?]({% link _posts/2008-04-03-Computer-Science-A-Science.md %})"
more debate has taken place on the CompSci.ca forums and blog as a result of a
blog post by Tony entitled "[The most important programming language](http://compsci.ca/blog/the-most-important-programming-language/)".
Many good points were made, for instance: Tony suggested that many people become
confused between computer programming and computer science which I agree with.

Perhaps in response to this, Zeroth posted about computer science on his blog
with an article entitled "[What is Computer Science?](http://oddco.ca/zeroth/zblog/2008/08/26/what-is-computer-science/)" He commented that many
people in other disciplines make use of computer science as a way of expressing
some of their complex ideas that would otherwise be very difficult to express.

I'm always quite interested in this kind of debate and will continue to follow
anything further on the subject. After all the time I've been in school and all
the profs and other computer type people I've encountered I still have to side
closest to Zeroth and his post. Computer Science is separate from anything else
we have right now. It's a tool used to help describe complex phenomenon and
ideas that could not be otherwise expressed well. It's not completely math,
engineering or an art.

Computer Science is like connection between everything. With computers we can
express math through equations and logic within the computer. We can use
computers to aid in engineering with CAD and blueprints and models that help
with simulation of structures and devices. We can use a computer to create,
enhance and distribute music, paintings and video. To me computer science should
be trying to do what physics has always aimed for. Since we can use computer
science to connect everything we know and understand, we should try to
understand everything through the use of computer science. The aim of physics is
some magical grand unified theory of everything and I think this theory or
"concept of everything" will only be possible from advances in computer science.
