On December 2nd and 4th 2008, Research Day for the Computer Science Department at the University of Guelph is taking place. Research Day is a day where many of the graduate and some undergraduate students present research projects in various stages. For the graduate students the projects consist of initial results and proposals for thesis documents while the undergrads present results from their research projects.

I am scheduled so far to present on December 4th at 12:30 - 12:50 pm. Update: I am now scheduled to talk December 8th at 10:00 am - 10:20 am (see below). The topic for my talk is not yet finalized however it will likely be something in the area of fair scheduling in wireless mesh networks with multiple gateways. I will report on my progress thus far in my M.Sc. and give a proposal for my remaining work in the next few months. The plan is to have the first draft of my thesis complete by February, the final draft by March and defend by the end of April.

Check back later for another post with the presentation slides and possibly some pictures from research day at Guelph.

Update: My advisor, Dr. Denko is away at a conference in New Orleans so my talk has been pushed back a couple of days. It will be on December 8th at 10:00 am if you happen to be in Guelph and would like to come and watch me give my talk :). ~~Also if you are interested my presentation slides are available at my academic website: http://www.uoguelph.ca/~jernst/research.shtml. Look for the slides on preliminary results. These are also the results I have submitted to the AINA 2009 conference. ~~ TODO: Dig into files to find this presentation.
