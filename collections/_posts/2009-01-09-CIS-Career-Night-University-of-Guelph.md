On January 28th, the Computer Science department at the University of Guelph is having their annual Career Night. It's being put on with the help of [CISters](http://www.cisters.ca/) and some other campus student groups. I attended one of these events last year and met some really interesting people. Anyone who is at Guelph and can attend should definitely go! At the career night, many alumnus of the computer program at Guelph are invited back to the school to share their experiences and to answer questions about their career since graduating.

The people I met last year ranged from successful entrepreneurs to those just climbing the corporate ladder to those who were in more of a management position in the company. Talking with the people can also be an important connection that could help you find a job more easily when you finish at Guelph as well! The night runs from 6:30 until 8:30 pm. Here is a Facebook event you can check out for more information: http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=113507310606
