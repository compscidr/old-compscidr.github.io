Just a quick post to let any readers know why there has been a lack of posts on the blog lately. I have been working like crazy on my thesis with the hope of completing it in the next month or so. I have also been preparing for the AINA 2009 conference I will be presenting at Bradford University in England. Also I have been working on a paper for a conference in Toronto (TIC-STH 2009 I think) with a deadline of May 1st May 31st (extended). So there's been alot going on and not much time.

As soon as I get the thesis completed though I hope to post alot more new content on the blog (as well as a potential redesign since this one seems a little cluttered and busy to me). Check back soon for alot more in-depth info on using ns3 since that is what I have been using for my thesis experiments lately. Update: I am set to defend on May 18th at Guelph. Let me know if you are interested in attending, I will provide more details via email.

In other news, the University of Guelph has officially accepted me to their Ph.D program to start in the Fall of this year (still under Dr. Denko) so I am pretty excited about having the opportunity to continue my research in Wireless Networks. ~~I am still waiting on responses from a couple of other schools (Waterloo & Calgary) so if I end up getting accepted to either of those I will have quite a decision to make.~~ **Update: I have accepted a position at the University of Guelph and will be starting there in the fall of 2009.**
