Well this is my first real attempt at blogging.  I finally got around to setting
up the domain and some hosting so here I am.  The purpose of this post will be
to outline what exactly my blog is going to be about since it seems like as good
a place as any to start. 

First of all, since I am currently a student and
probably will be for a long time I decided on the name of the blog with this in
mind.  Basically that means your reading the thoughts of a 22 year old computer
science student.

You can expect the majority of the content of this site to be tech based and
nerdy as well as some scattered opinions and politics since I'll likely get off
topic at times.  Additionally, ill post useful tutorials, neat facts I've found
around the internet or read about in newspapers, books or anything else I can
get a hold of.  There's not much else to say right now so I'll leave it at that.
