Today I completed the listing page for all of the presentations our research
group PerWin at the University of Guelph has made in the last year or so. PerWin
stands for Pervasive Computing and Wireless Networking Research. The group is
directed by my advisor, Dr. Mieso Denko and has several graduate students who
are active research members in the group. We have given presentations on topics
ranging from Wireless Mesh Networks protocols, Autonomous networks, Fair
Scheduling, Load Balancing, RFID, Wireless Security and much more. We have also
had special invited talks by several faculty members from various Universities
around Ontario (Ryerson, UOIT).

~~Check out the schedule page here for the list of presentations, presenters
and topics~~ - This page is no longer up since I graduated quite some time ago.
There are also listings of many of the websites for the presenters which may be
a good resource for people interested in our work. If you are a faculty member
interested in giving a talk contact Dr. Mieso Denko at the University of Guelph.

~~If you are interested in any of the talks I have given, all of the powerpoint
presentations are available at my Academic Website at the University of Guelph.
~~ Again, since the website is not up any longer, the presentations are likely
not available. TODO: Dig through my old files and see if I can directly link
to the pdfs of the talks here for posterity.
