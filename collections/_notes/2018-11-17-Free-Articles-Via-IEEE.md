Just a quick post today since I'm strapped for time, but thought its pretty useful (and almost a reminder to myself to check this out later). The IEEE has put a bunch of articles related to wireless networks written by leaders in the field up for free for a limited time.

(I know this doesn't benefit me directly since I already belong to those societies and could probably get access to them through my libraries, but they seem interesting enough and I will likely read at least a few the next chance I get). It's also helpful for those people who don't necessarily have normal access to IEEE articles a chance to try them out. Topics include Pervasive Computing, Internet Computing, Security, RFIDs and more. Check it out if you get a chance!
