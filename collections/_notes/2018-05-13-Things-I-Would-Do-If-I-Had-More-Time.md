Since I've spent the morning procrastinating and relaxing I figured I would write small entry on what types of things I would like to do if I had more time:

* Write a program the can predict which team is most likely to win in sports matches based on statistics of the players, teams etc.
* Start a community-free internet access program in my neighbourhood using Wireless Mesh Network technology I am researching
* Learn to code in a new language
* Write a paper on Fair Scheduling & Load Balancing
* Travel
* Scheme on ways to make easy money so I can do the above more often
