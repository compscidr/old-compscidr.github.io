This is my personal homepage, built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for
templating, [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) for code highlighting, and
[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) for modular css components.

The template is inspired by
[plainwhite](https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll),
[hugo basic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/) and
[hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

Previously, I have used a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) website with a
custom theme and some plugins which I wrote, however, I'm less interested in
hosting, or running a server with PHP in order to have a website. I also wrote
for a brief period on [Medium](https://medium.com/@compscidr), but prefer to
have content controlled by me rather than depending on their platform.

Since github can host pages made in Jekyll, I thought I'd give it a shot.
